Setting up the CloudWatch CPU alarm using terraform code

"providers.tf" states which cloud provider we are using.
In terraform terms,we call these providers as "plugins" so that Terraform installs to interact with remote system.This provider configuration can also be declared in root module.But it always a best practice to use as a seperate .tf file.
